## Reporting issues

We would love to help if you are having a problem. Feel free to open an issue with as much detail as possible.

## Contributing code

Contributions are encouraged through GitHub Pull Requests.

Guidelines when adding new code:

* Create tests when possible.
* Ensure the entire test suite still passes by running `rake`.
* Ensure code conventions are maintained by running `bundle exec rubocop`.
